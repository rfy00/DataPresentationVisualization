<b><i>Intro</i></b> - In one of the Data Science classes I took, we had to create different visualizations in Tableau.  The visualizations had to do with is aircraft travel safer than vehicle travel.  The visualizations that are presented in this GitHub folder are an Executive Summary PowerPoint, infographic, PDF file with 5 charts on it, and a final PowerPoint presentation.

<b><i>Tools</i></b> - Tableau, Excel, Powerpoint, and Word

<b><i>Methods/Evaluation/Techniques</i></b> - I cleaned the various datasets, summarized the various pieces of useful data, and used various statistical methods to evaluate the data.

<b><i>Conclusion</i></b> - Overall, I found that aircraft travel is safer than vehicle travel.  This is due to there can be a lot of aircrafts in the traveling in the air and aircraft travel is a regulated industry.  Even though, vehicles have fewer people, there are a lot more vehicles travel daily than aircrafts.  Also, there are a lot more risks when vehicles travel on roads that can cause accidents and potential deaths.
