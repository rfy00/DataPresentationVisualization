<b><i>Intro</i></b> - Cities and towns across the world have some type of crime that is reported every year.  Many bigger cities, such as Phoenix, Arizona, have a lot of violent and non-violent crime in different parts of the city.  Various dams that were built in Arizona in the early to mid-1900s, paved the way for Phoenix to become the capitol of Arizona in 1912.  These dams provided power to different areas of the state.  During the second World War, Phoenix started becoming an economic hub for local residents and migrants.  In the 1960s and 70s, there started to be several problems when Phoenix started growing a lot.  For instance, street gangs turned certain parts of Phoenix into areas where you did not want to go due to crime (i.e. South Phoenix and near downtown area).  

Fast forwards to the 1990s and beyond, Phoenix/metro area was becoming and still is a popular city for relocation of individuals and families.  Many bars, restaurants, and shops were/are opening up and/or relocating to the area.  This helped with Phoenix and the surrounding suburbs revitalization, economic, and housing boom.  In 2018, the estimated population of Phoenix was 1.66 million people, the median age was 33.5, and poverty rate was estimated to be at 19.4% (Data USA, 2021).  Also in 2018, the median household income was $57,957 and the median property value was $249,100 (Data USA, 2021).

In 2021, Arizona violent and property crimes have dropped.  â€œViolent crime incidents dipped from 4.7 per 1,000 people to 4.6, and property crime fell from 26.8 incidents per 1,000 to 24.4 (Edwards, 2021).  Compared to all of the 50 states, Arizona has the fourteenth highest property crime rate and the tenth highest violent crime rate (Edwards, 2021).  Phoenix ranked the thirty-second safest city in Arizona. (based on Phoenix AZ Crime Data Analysis Report.docx)
