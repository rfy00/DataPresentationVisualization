Intro - Data preparation needs to be completed on datasets no matter how simple they are. Airports have a lot of flight and airport information that can be analyzed to see how many flight departures and arrivals there are, how many people are leaving there cars overnight or staying a few hours, and the type of ground transportation people are using.

Tools - Python, SQLite3, Website, API, CSV, and Tableau

Data - The following datasets that were used are from https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset?organization=aviation The datasets include November 2019 Aviation Parking, Aviation Ground Transportation, and Aviation Flight Information.

Methods/Evaluation/Techniques - I analyzed the datasets that were from an API, CSV, and Phoenix Open Data website to figure out the common components that i could pull the data together. Then, I used Tableau to pull the data into graphs and charts.

Conclusion - Overall, there was a lot of data cleaning to complete based on the different ways of pulling data and making sure they were all in the correct format. Also, I found that there were a lot of departures, arrivals, vehicles that came through the airport, and a lot of people that parked their cars overnight in airport parking.
